## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

Before running the project, make sure to have the latest Python distribution installed, as well as OpenCV contributions for facial recognition functionality 🖱️.

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use **pip** to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-contrib-python
     ```
## Usage 💻
To use this project, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Scan a Face 🤳
First, scan your face or someone else's using the camera. 📸

2. Train the Face Data 🏋️‍♀️
After scanning, train the system with the face data. 🧠

3. Use the Detector 🔍
You can now use the face detector to check the database for criminal records. 🚔

4. Example of Usage 🖥️
After completing the setup steps, you can run the following command to launch the system:

  ```bash
python mainApp.py
  ```
This will start the application where you can begin scanning faces and training the system.
